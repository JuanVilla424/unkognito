## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìã Prerequisites

**Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements**:

- **GitHub Account:** You need a GitHub account to use GitHub Actions.
- **Python 3.12+:** Ensure Python is installed on your local machine.
- **Git:** Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository.
- **NVM:** (Optional) Node.js installation environment versions control
- **Node.js 22.x+**: (Optional) (Required to Push) Used as lint orchestration manager in pre-commit and pre-push

### üî® Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuanVilla424/github-cicd-template.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   ```bash
    cd github-cicd-template
   ```

### üîß Environment Setup

**Mandatory: Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment**

Setting up a Python virtual environment ensures that dependencies are managed effectively and do not interfere with other projects.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   On Unix or MacOS:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   - or

   ```bash
    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Upgrade pip**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install poetry
   poetry lock
   poetry install
   ```

   - Deactivate the Virtual Environment

   When you're done, deactivate the environment:

   ```bash
    deactivate
   ```

5. **Docker Extra Steps**: Install Scoop and then install hadolint using scoop, refer to [Extra Steps](#-extra-steps)

### üõ∏ Pre-Commit Hooks

**Install and check pre-commit hooks**: MD files changes countermeasures, python format, python lint, yaml format, yaml lint, version control hook, changelog auto-generation

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install -t pre-commit
pre-commit install -t pre-push
pre-commit autoupdate
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### üìå Extra Steps

1. **Docker**:

   - Using MacOs or Linux:
     ```bash
     brew install hadolint
     ```
   - On Windows **as non-admin user**:
     ```bash
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
     Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
     scoop install halint
     ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

**To utilize the CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps**:

1. **Configure GitHub Actions**

   - Navigate to the .github/workflows/ directory.
   - Customize the ci.yml file according to your project's requirements.
   - Customize the python.yml file to format and lint python code.
   - Customize the node.yml file to format and lint node.js code if you are hosting frontend.
   - Customize the release-controller file to add or remove **[backend, frontend, docker deployment, database]**

2. **Set Up Secrets**

   - Go to your GitHub repository settings.
   - Navigate to Secrets and add necessary secrets like CODECOV_KEY, etc.

3. **Triggering the Pipeline**

   - Push to Branches: Pushing code to dev, test, prod, or main branches will trigger the pipeline.
   - Pull Requests: Opening or updating pull requests will run tests and checks.

4. **Monitoring Pipeline Status**
   - Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the status of your workflows.
   - Integrate notifications with Slack, Email, or other communication tools for real-time updates.
